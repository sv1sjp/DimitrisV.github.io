Today, I ran an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) scenario using ChatGPT Search Engine.
📋 Scenario
The goal was to find as much information as possible about myself, my family members, and partners, using only my hashtag#HamRadio callsign (SV1SJP) as the starting point.
 📊 Results
I successfully found details about myself, my father, Kyriakos Giannakis and various projects they have been involved with over the past 10 years, as well as other related information. Then, I asked ChatGPT to summarize the main information it gathered for each of these individuals.

❌ I noticed that ChatGPT Search avoids sourcing information directly from LinkedIn or family tree websites. Most of the information came from official websites, Wikipedia, and blogs related to the requested topic.

📁 As a case study, I attached the entire conversation I had with ChatGPT as a PDF, to show all the prompts and answers.
💡 Takeaway: ChatGPT can support efficient information gathering, revealing surprising insights and connections with minimal effort.

🔐 Why Use Unconventional Query Styles?
* To help access information stored in less-optimized formats or forums where English isn’t perfect, such as localized discussions and community-driven content.
* Avoiding polished English potentially helps find content that isn’t overly optimized for SEO, leading to more organic, user-generated insights (e.g., informative blog posts).
* ...Avoiding Potential Bans/Blocks from ChatGPT :P


ChatGPT Search Engine seems promising!!! :)
