# 🏠 TuxHouse

TuxHouse is an educational platform 🎓 that provides *free* educational videos 📺 and e-books 📚 about cybersecurity 🔒, blockchain ⛓, Linux 🐧 and Android 📱.


## 🎬 Our Journey 

The channel began its journey as **DimitrisV** back in 2014, primarily as an Android Hacking Channel 📱🔒. Eager to broaden our scope and bring more valuable content to our community, we underwent a rebranding process, emerging as **TuxHouse** 🏠 in late 2022. Since the rebranding, we've released a plethora of new episodes, including full-courses and shorts, covering a wider range of topics.
