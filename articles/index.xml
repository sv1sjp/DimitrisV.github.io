📋 Scenario
The goal was to find as much information as possible about myself, my family members, and partners, using only my hashtag#HamRadio callsign (SV1SJP) as the starting point.
📊 Results
I successfully found details about myself, my father, Kyriakos Giannakis and various projects they have been involved with over the past 10 years, as well as other related information. Then, I asked ChatGPT to summarize the main information it gathered for each of these individuals.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Today, I ran an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) scenario using ChatGPT Search Engine.

&lt;p>❌ I noticed that ChatGPT Search avoids sourcing information directly from LinkedIn or family tree websites. Most of the information came from official websites, Wikipedia, and blogs related to the requested topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>📁 As a case study, I attached the entire conversation I had with ChatGPT as a PDF, to show all the prompts and answers.
💡 Takeaway: ChatGPT can support efficient information gathering, revealing surprising insights and connections with minimal effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🔐 Why Use Unconventional Query Styles?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To help access information stored in less-optimized formats or forums where English isn’t perfect, such as localized discussions and community-driven content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoiding polished English potentially helps find content that isn’t overly optimized for SEO, leading to more organic, user-generated insights (e.g., informative blog posts).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;Avoiding Potential Bans/Blocks from ChatGPT :P&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>ChatGPT Search Engine seems promising!!! :)&lt;/p>
